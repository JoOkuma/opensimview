This repository provides all information for building a 2 detection and 2 illumination simultaneous multiview objective -- inclding a complete parts list, CAD drawings, control software, hardware building guide and sofwtare setup instructions.

This design is original but heavily influenced by the SiMView design by the [Keller Lab](https://www.janelia.org/lab/keller-lab), and in particular these two publications:
